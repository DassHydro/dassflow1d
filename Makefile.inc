#  This file is part of the DassFlow software (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows).
#  DassFlow is a computational software whose purpose is to simulate geophysical free surface flows,
#  designed for variational sensitivities and data assimilation (4D-var). Inverse capabilities are
#  based on the adjoint code generation by a source-to-source algorithmic differentiation (Tapenade software used).
#
#  DassFlow software includes few mostly independent "modules" with common architectures and structures:
#    - 1D Shallow Module (1D Shallow Water Model, Finite Volume/Finite Difference Methods), i.e. the present code.
#    - 2D Shallow Module (2D Shallow Water Model, Finite Volume Method)
#    - 3D Module (Full Stokes Model, Finite Element Method, Mobile Gometries, ALE).
#  Please consult the DassFlow webpage for more details: http://www-gmm.insa-toulouse.fr/~monnier/DassFlow/.
#
#  Many people have contributed to the DassFlow development from the initial version to the latest ones.
#  Current main developers or scientific contributers are:
#               F. Couderc (CNRS & Mathematics Institute of Toulouse IMT).
#               K. Larnier (C.S Communication and Systems & INSA Toulouse).
